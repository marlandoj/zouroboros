## 🟡 P1 - Important

### Everything-Claude-Code Research (Evaluation Required)
> Concepts derived from analyzing the Anthropic Hackathon-winning everything-claude-code repository (affaan-m/everything-claude-code). These require spec-first evaluation before implementation.

#### [ECC-001] Lifecycle Hook System
**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 weeks)  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-04-01)
**Impact**: High — enables live-session continuation, not just test harness

Event-driven hooks that fire at structured points in the conversation lifecycle:
- `.on("conversation.start")` — session begin
- `.on("conversation.end")` — session close → trigger memory capture
- `.on("task.complete")` — swarm task done → post-result capture
- `.on("task.fail")` — failure → extract failure pattern
- `.on("tool.call", { tool: "Bash" })` — specific tool usage
- `.on("mutation.complete")` — file changed → extract decision
- `.on("memory.threshold")` — token budget % exceeded → checkpoint

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Hook registry system with typed events (2026-04-01)
- [x] Event payloads with relevant context (2026-04-01)
- [x] Async handlers with error isolation (2026-04-01)
- [x] Integration with existing continuation eval system (2026-04-01)
- [x] Configurable hooks via skills/agents (2026-04-01)

**Evaluation Questions**:
- How does this differ from existing rule conditions?
- What events should be in v1 vs future expansion?
- Should hooks be file-based (like ECC) or programmatic?

---

#### [ECC-002] Slash Commands Hub
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: Medium (1 week)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-04-01)
**Impact**: High — makes skills ergonomic to invoke from any persona

First-class CLI-style commands for Zouroboros operations:
```
/memory store|search|stats|evolve
/swarm run|status|cancel|history
/eval run|check|report
/profile show|update|export
/skill list|install|update|evolve
/sessions branch|compact|search|metrics
```

Each command is a zero-dependency script callable from any persona conversation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Command parser with subcommands and flags (2026-04-01)
- [x] Unified help system (2026-04-01)
- [x] Integration with memory gate for auto-capture on `/` commands (2026-04-01)
- [x] Tab completion support (2026-04-01)
- [x] Cross-skill command registration (2026-04-01)

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Should this be a standalone skill or core CLI enhancement?
- How does this relate to existing skill invocation patterns?
- What's the namespace collision strategy?

---

#### [ECC-003] Session Management (Branch / Search / Compact / Metrics)
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: Medium-Large (2 weeks)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-04-01)
**Impact**: High — directly improves production reliability via proactive compaction

Active session management capabilities:
- **Branch** — fork a session, explore in isolation
- **Search** — full-text search across session history
- **Compact** — Ollama summarization + context trim
- **Metrics** — tokens/session, success rate, tool usage stats

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Session branching with isolated contexts (2026-04-01)
- [x] FTS index of session messages (2026-04-01)
- [x] Ollama-powered compaction with summary generation (2026-04-01)
- [x] Per-session metrics dashboard (2026-04-01)
- [x] Checkpoint/restore integration (2026-04-01)

**Evaluation Questions**:
- How does this integrate with existing checkpoint system?
- What's the storage overhead for session history?
- Should this be memory-system feature or new skill?

---

#### [ECC-004] Instincts — Pattern Auto-Extraction
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: Large (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-04-01)
**Impact**: High — converts recurring failures into hot-loadable safeguards

Automatic extraction of behavioral patterns from sessions:
1. Detect pattern (repeated workflow, failure recurrence)
2. Score confidence (frequency × recency × distinctiveness)
3. Extract as instinct file
4. Skill hot-load into future sessions

**Proposed Instinct Schema**:
```yaml
name: ffb-autoposter-approval-loop
confidence: 0.82
pattern: "autoposter skips posts labeled 'approved' instead of 'approved/ready'"
trigger: "autoposter + approval keyword in same session"
resolution: "Check 'approved' label exact spelling in FFB content calendar"
evidence_count: 3
last_seen: 2026-03-28
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Pattern detection from session logs (2026-04-01)
- [x] Confidence scoring algorithm (2026-04-01)
- [x] Instinct file format and storage (2026-04-01)
- [x] Hot-load mechanism for instinct injection (2026-04-01)
- [x] UI for reviewing/approving extracted instincts (2026-04-01)

**Evaluation Questions**:
- How does this differ from procedural memory evolution?
- What's the false positive rate for pattern detection?
- Should instincts be manual-reviewed before activation?

---

#### [ECC-005] Token Budget Hook Wiring
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: Medium (1 week)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-04-01)
**Impact**: High — closes gap between eval fixture and live sessions

Systematic token optimization with proactive checkpointing:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Context at 60% | Switch to leaner injection (facts only, no episodes) |
| Context at 80% | Auto-compact oldest episode, prune low-confidence facts |
| Context at 90% | Full checkpoint to `AGENTS.md` update, new session prompt |
| Swarm run >50% context | Pause mid-wave, capture state, resume in new session |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Real-time context monitoring (2026-04-01)
- [x] Progressive compression strategies (2026-04-01)
- [x] Automatic checkpoint at critical thresholds (2026-04-01)
- [x] Swarm wave pause/resume for context budget (2026-04-01)
- [x] Integration with continuation eval (2026-04-01)

**Evaluation Questions**:
- How does this interact with ECC-001 hooks vs rules?
- What are the optimal threshold percentages?
- How to handle mid-task interruption gracefully?

### Repository Consolidation & Deprecation
- [ ] **Migrate individual repos to monorepo** - Deprecate zo-swarm-orchestrator, zo-memory-system, etc. in favor of Zouroboros monorepo
  - **Trigger**: When Zouroboros repo goes public
  - **Strategy**: Archive with redirect notices (preserve history via git subtree)
  - **Impact**: Stars reset to zero; forks orphaned but functional; deep links break

  **Pre-Public (Current - Private Monorepo):**
  - [x] **Create paired-branch automation script** - `scripts/paired-branch.sh` for managing cross-repo changes
  - [x] **Create automated check agent** - Scheduled Tue/Fri 10 AM to detect unpaired changes
    - Agent runs `scripts/check-paired-branches.sh --notify`
    - Emails if issues found (uncommitted changes, unpaired branches, open PRs)
  - [ ] Use hybrid paired-branch strategy for cross-repo changes:
    ```bash
    # Create branches across all repos
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh swarm-cascade-fix
    
    # Or for specific repos only
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh memory-hyde zo-memory-system,zo-swarm-orchestrator
    
    # Check status of existing workflow
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh --status feat/swarm-cascade-fix
    
    # Manual check (also runs via scheduled agent Tue/Fri 10 AM)
    ./scripts/check-paired-branches.sh
    ```
  - [ ] Create feature branches in both repos with matching names: `feat/swarm-cascade-fix`
  - [ ] Open PRs in parallel; merge zo-swarm-orchestrator first, then Zouroboros
  - [ ] Document dependency order in PR descriptions

  **Post-Public Deprecation Plan:**
  
  | Phase | Action | Output |
  |-------|--------|--------|
  | 1 | Archive individual repos with deprecation README | `github.com/user/repo` → archived, read-only |
  | 2 | Subtree merge preserving full git history | `packages/swarm-orchestrator/` with blame intact |
  | 3 | Export critical open issues to monorepo migration tracking issue | Single #1 issue with checklist |
  | 4 | Update all package.json/go.mod paths | Dependencies point to monorepo subpaths |
  | 5 | Pin monorepo to profile; update bio | Star accumulation begins fresh |

  **Asset Preservation:**
  | Asset | Fate | Mitigation |
  |-------|------|------------|
  | Stars | Lost (reset to 0) | Pin monorepo; stars recover over time |
  | Forks | Orphaned (still functional) | Archive rather than delete |
  | Deep links | Broken | README redirect notices in archived repos |
  | Issues/PRs | Archived (visible, locked) | Export critical ones pre-archive |
  | Git history | Preserved | Use `git subtree` for full history |

  **Repos to Deprecate:**
  - `zo-swarm-orchestrator` → `packages/swarm-orchestrator/`
  - `zo-memory-system` → `packages/memory-system/`
  - (Add others as they migrate)

  **Command Reference for Subtree Migration:**
  ```bash
  git remote add swarm ../zo-swarm-orchestrator
  git fetch swarm
  git subtree add --prefix=packages/swarm-orchestrator swarm main
  git remote remove swarm
  ```
