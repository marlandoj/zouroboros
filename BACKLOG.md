## 🔴 P0 - Critical

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Unit test suite** - Achieve 80%+ coverage across all packages
- [ ] **Integration tests** - End-to-end tests for critical paths
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** - GitHub Actions for automated testing on PRs
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** - Memory, latency, throughput baselines

### Core Stability
- [ ] **Error recovery mechanisms** - Graceful degradation when subsystems fail
- [ ] **Database migration system** - Versioned schema migrations for memory DB
- [ ] **Configuration validation** - Runtime schema validation with helpful errors
- [ ] **Backup/restore utilities** - Automated backup scripts for memory data

---

## 🟡 P1 - Important

### Repository Consolidation & Deprecation
- [ ] **Migrate individual repos to monorepo** - Deprecate zo-swarm-orchestrator, zo-memory-system, etc. in favor of Zouroboros monorepo
  - **Trigger**: When Zouroboros repo goes public
  - **Strategy**: Archive with redirect notices (preserve history via git subtree)
  - **Impact**: Stars reset to zero; forks orphaned but functional; deep links break

  **Pre-Public (Current - Private Monorepo):**
  - [x] **Create paired-branch automation script** - `scripts/paired-branch.sh` for managing cross-repo changes
  - [x] **Create automated check agent** - Scheduled Tue/Fri 10 AM to detect unpaired changes
    - Agent runs `scripts/check-paired-branches.sh --notify`
    - Emails if issues found (uncommitted changes, unpaired branches, open PRs)
  - [ ] Use hybrid paired-branch strategy for cross-repo changes:
    ```bash
    # Create branches across all repos
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh swarm-cascade-fix
    
    # Or for specific repos only
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh memory-hyde zo-memory-system,zo-swarm-orchestrator
    
    # Check status of existing workflow
    ./scripts/paired-branch.sh --status feat/swarm-cascade-fix
    
    # Manual check (also runs via scheduled agent Tue/Fri 10 AM)
    ./scripts/check-paired-branches.sh
    ```
  - [ ] Create feature branches in both repos with matching names: `feat/swarm-cascade-fix`
  - [ ] Open PRs in parallel; merge zo-swarm-orchestrator first, then Zouroboros
  - [ ] Document dependency order in PR descriptions

  **Post-Public Deprecation Plan:**
  
  | Phase | Action | Output |
  |-------|--------|--------|
  | 1 | Archive individual repos with deprecation README | `github.com/user/repo` → archived, read-only |
  | 2 | Subtree merge preserving full git history | `packages/swarm-orchestrator/` with blame intact |
  | 3 | Export critical open issues to monorepo migration tracking issue | Single #1 issue with checklist |
  | 4 | Update all package.json/go.mod paths | Dependencies point to monorepo subpaths |
  | 5 | Pin monorepo to profile; update bio | Star accumulation begins fresh |

  **Asset Preservation:**
  | Asset | Fate | Mitigation |
  |-------|------|------------|
  | Stars | Lost (reset to 0) | Pin monorepo; stars recover over time |
  | Forks | Orphaned (still functional) | Archive rather than delete |
  | Deep links | Broken | README redirect notices in archived repos |
  | Issues/PRs | Archived (visible, locked) | Export critical ones pre-archive |
  | Git history | Preserved | Use `git subtree` for full history |

  **Repos to Deprecate:**
  - `zo-swarm-orchestrator` → `packages/swarm-orchestrator/`
  - `zo-memory-system` → `packages/memory-system/`
  - (Add others as they migrate)

  **Command Reference for Subtree Migration:**
  ```bash
  git remote add swarm ../zo-swarm-orchestrator
  git fetch swarm
  git subtree add --prefix=packages/swarm-orchestrator swarm main
  git remote remove swarm
  ```
