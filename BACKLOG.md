## 🟢 P2 — Nice to Have

### Everything-Claude-Code Research (Continued)

#### [ECC-006] Manifest-Driven Selective Install
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
**Status**: Proposed → Needs Evaluation
**Impact**: Medium — enables selective deployment (e.g., memory-only, swarm-only)

Component manifest for installing only needed Zouroboros features:
```yaml
# zo-ecosystem/manifest.yaml
components:
  memory: { skills: [zo-memory-system], agents: 1, tools: [memory.ts] }
  swarm: { skills: [zo-swarm-orchestrator], agents: 3, tools: [orchestrate-v4.ts] }
  vault: { skills: [zo-vault], agents: 1 }
  finance: { skills: [alpaca-trading-skill, backtesting-skill], agents: 1 }
```

Install: `zo-ecosystem install --profile minimal` or `zo-ecosystem install memory swarm`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Manifest schema definition
- [ ] Dependency resolution
- [ ] Install/uninstall commands
- [ ] State tracking of installed components
- [ ] Incremental update support

---

#### [ECC-007] Multi-Harness Abstraction
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Medium-Large (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: Proposed → Needs Evaluation
**Impact**: Medium — extend Zouroboros to work with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.

Make Zouroboros skills work equally well across harnesses:
- Claude Code (.claude/)
- Codex (.codex/)
- Cursor (.cursor/)
- Gemini CLI (via bridge scripts)
- Hermes (native)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Harness detection
- [ ] Per-harness config overlays
- [ ] Bridge script compatibility matrix
- [ ] Harness-specific tool mapping
- [ ] Unified skill format across harnesses

---

#### [ECC-008] Skill Evolution as Closed Loop
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Large (3-4 weeks)
**Status**: Proposed → Needs Evaluation
**Impact**: Medium — self-improving skill system

Closed-loop skill evolution:
```
Success → extract winning pattern → evolve skill version → test against eval fixture → promote
Failure → classify error type → flag skill for review → update instructions → retest
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Success pattern extraction
- [ ] Skill version management
- [ ] Automated test-on-evolve
- [ ] Promotion/demotion workflows
- [ ] Evolution history tracking

---

#### [ECC-009] Observer Loop Guard (5-Layer)
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Small (2-3 days)
**Status**: Proposed → Needs Evaluation
**Impact**: Medium — prevents recursive routing loops

Guard against self-referential routing loops:
1. Request origin tracking
2. Loop depth limit
3. Cyclic call detection
4. Timeout on recursive chains
5. Circuit breaker for detected loops

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Origin header propagation
- [ ] Loop detection algorithm
- [ ] Automatic loop breaking
- [ ] Alerting on loop incidents

---

#### [ECC-010] Memory Explosion Throttling
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Small (1-2 days)
**Status**: Proposed → Needs Evaluation
**Impact**: Medium — prevents vector DB bloat

Prevent excessive embedding generation:
- **Throttle**: max N embeddings per conversation minute
- **Tail sampling**: keep only last K captures when limit hit
- **Cooldown**: don't re-embed same content within 5 minutes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Rate limiting on embedding generation
- [ ] Duplicate detection with cooldown
- [ ] Sampling strategy for overflow
- [ ] Metrics on throttled embeddings

---

### Swarm Orchestrator

#### AgentKV/CortexDB Evaluation for Memory Backend
**Status**: Proposed → Spike Required
**Effort**: Medium-Large (2-3 weeks for evaluation + decision)
**Impact**: High — Potential replacement for SQLite+Ollama stack

Evaluate AgentKV (Python/C++) and CortexDB (Go) as potential backends for zo-memory-system. Both offer local-first, single-file graph+vector storage.

| Criteria | Current (SQLite+Ollama) | AgentKV | CortexDB |
|----------|------------------------|---------|----------|
| Language | TypeScript/Bun | Python/C++ | Go |
| Storage | SQLite file | Single mmap'd file | SQLite-backed |
| Vector Search | Ollama (external) | HNSW (embedded) | HNSW (embedded) |
| Graph | Custom adjacency table | Property graph edges | Knowledge graph |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Functional TypeScript bindings for CortexDB
- [ ] Benchmark suite comparing current vs. CortexDB vs. AgentKV
- [ ] Decision document with migration plan or rejection rationale
- [ ] If accepted: migration path for existing users

**Rationale**: Current SQLite+Ollama stack works but has latency overhead. Embedded vector+graph could reduce search latency from ~4s to <100ms.

### Memory System

#### Memory v4 Enhancements (Migrated from zouroboros-memory-system)
**Status**: Migrated 2026-04-01
**Impact**: High — 9 new capabilities in packages/memory/src/

Migrated scripts from `zouroboros-memory-system` into the monorepo:

| ID | Feature | File |
|----|---------|------|
| MEM-001 | Context Budget Awareness | `context-budget.ts` |
| MEM-002 | Recursive Episode Summarization | `episode-summarizer.ts` |
| MEM-003 | Iterative Multi-Hop Retrieval | `multi-hop.ts` |
| MEM-101 | Memory System Metrics Dashboard | `metrics.ts` |
| MEM-102 | Import Pipeline (ChatGPT, Obsidian, Markdown) | `import-pipeline.ts` |
| MEM-103 | Memory Conflict Resolution | `conflict-resolver.ts` |
| MEM-104 | Cross-Persona Memory Sharing | `cross-persona.ts` |
| MEM-105 | Enhanced Knowledge Graph Traversal | `graph-traversal.ts` |
| MEM-202 | Embedding Model Benchmark | `embedding-benchmark.ts` |

#### [MEM-201] Vector Database Migration
**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: High (5-7 days)
**Impact**: Medium — scale beyond 10k facts

Current: SQLite + in-memory vector similarity (brute force).
Proposed: Add LanceDB or pgvector for >10k facts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] LanceDB integration with SQLite fallback
- [ ] Migration path for existing embeddings
- [ ] Benchmark: query latency vs fact count
- [ ] Hybrid search uses HNSW when available

**Blocker**: Current scale (~1k facts) doesn't justify complexity. Revisit at 10k+ facts.

### Repository Consolidation (Remaining)

- [ ] **Migrate remaining individual repos to monorepo** — Deprecate zo-swarm-orchestrator, zo-memory-system, etc.
  - Use hybrid paired-branch strategy for cross-repo changes
  - Open PRs in parallel; merge individual repos first, then monorepo
  - Document dependency order in PR descriptions

**Post-Public Deprecation Plan:**

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Archive individual repos with deprecation README | Archived, read-only |
| 2 | Subtree merge preserving full git history | `packages/` with blame intact |
| 3 | Export critical open issues to monorepo | Single tracking issue |
| 4 | Update all package.json paths | Dependencies point to monorepo |
| 5 | Pin monorepo to profile; update bio | Star accumulation begins fresh |

**Repos to Deprecate:**
- `zo-swarm-orchestrator` → `packages/swarm/`
- ~~`zo-memory-system`~~ → `packages/memory/` (v4 enhancements migrated 2026-04-01)
- ~~`Projects/zouroboros-rag-expansion`~~ → `packages/rag/` ✅ (2026-04-01)
